            <p>
                Welcome to our cinematic bucket challenge!
                <br>
                <br>
                We crafted this challenge to ignite the passion of
                aspiring cinephiles like you, making it easier and more enjoyable to explore the captivating
                world of film. We know you’re probably eager to begin your journey, but before you continue, we want
                to
                give you some tips and advice on how to use our site, and get the most enjoyment out of your
                experience.

                When you look up recommended movies online, you will often stumble upon short, uninspired listicles
                over
                the same ten movie recommendations, or links to purchase books with titles such as “1000 films to
                see
                before you die!”. We don’t have a thousand movie recommendations for you yet, but what we do have is
                a
                fun, ever-evolving film bucket list for you to go through!
                <br>
                <br>
                As these lists have a tendency to get very long and unwieldy, we have instead made our bucket
                challenge
                into smaller, bite-sized “mini-challenges”, each containing five films. We call these "Reels"! These
                films span many
                different
                time-periods and genres, and each selection is meant to give the viewer a broad taste of the many
                possibilities of the medium!
                <br>
                <br>
                We sincerely hope you enjoy your journey - so make some popcorn, turn of the lights and let’s get
                into
                the first film!
